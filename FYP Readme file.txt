### Market problem:
Keyboard is the static and traditional method to interact with computer and games, for which player need to sit on a chair at a corner in static position for long time. Which effect health, especially repetitive strain injury (R.S.I) and blood circulation due to sit on a place
for long time in static position.

Besides that, often typing mistakes make the reason of game over. Which is bad experience for players.

#### Problem with keyboard use:
- Extra hardware
- Load on system and consume device charge
- keys loss functionality, stack or hard to press
- Miss use can lead us to repair (laptop keyboard)

### Problem Solution:
We create dynamic web cam hand tracking system, with help of player could control the game dynamic with body motion (gestures), which can be perform on chair or in a standing position.it not only protect health from damage but as long as player play the game, will get physical exercise.

Besides that, dynamic physical interaction make the game more interesting and effective.

#### Benefits:
- Long time pc use but healthy
- Get enjoyment and body exercise
- Make the games more interesting
- Dynamic physical interaction with pc
- no need of extra hardware
- less cost effective

### Possible Improvement
In feature, it is possible to convert the web tracking system to CCTV camera.
Where the player can play the game in particular room with more body tracking
functionalities and features.

Note: we will discuss it with our supervisor then will look forward

### Project deployment & deployment
#### Methodologies:
1. Computer vision (To detect hand)
2. Machine Learning (make predictions for upcoming matches)
3. Web development with database (For user interference & score storage)
4. Game development (Hill claim car racing game, online source)

### Python libraries use:
1. Mediapipe: will use for Hand Tracking
2. Opencv: opencv will help in image processing
3. TenserFlow: Tenserflow will help in understanding the hand gestures.

### Web development:
- Django
- Django rest Api's
### Database:
- Mysql databse
