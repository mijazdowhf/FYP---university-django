In "Ready Player One," there are a few different ways that players manage to walk and run through virtual reality while staying in place in the real world. Wade uses an omni-directional treadmill that he controls with his hands, feet and other body parts which allows him to travel in 360 degrees, at any speed he likes.

Is Ready Player 1 realistic?
Ernest Cline's novel Ready Player One demonstrates perhaps the most realistic fictional representation of futuristic virtual reality technology. With much of the tech he explores existing in some capacity even today, one can't help but imagine that this future fantasy he suggests may not be too far from reality.

Game mention:
James Halliday designs a virtual reality and hides the keys to his fortune in it for a worthy player to find after his death. Wade, a teenager, sets out on a quest to find the keys and the fortune.
